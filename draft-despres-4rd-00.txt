            IPv4 Residual Deployment on IPv6 infrastructure
                          draft-despres-4rd-00

Abstract

   This document specifies an automatic tunneling mechanism for
   providing IPv4 connectivity service to end users over a service
   provider's IPv6 network infrastructure.  During the long transition
   period from IPv4-only to IPv6-only, a service porvider's network
   infrastructure will have to deploy IPv6.  But they will also have to
   maintain some IPv4 connectivity for a number of customers, for both
   outgoing and incoming connections, and for both customer-individual
   and shared IPv4 addresses.  The 4rd solution (IPv4 Residual
   Deployment) is designed as a lightweight solution for this.

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Residual Deployment           February 2011


1.  Introduction

   During the long transition period from only IPv4 to IPv6, service
   provider's (SP's) infrastructure network will deploy IPv6.  However
   service provider has not only to offer IPv6 connectivity but also to
   maintain a residual IPv4 connectivity for outgoing and incoming
   connections.  While some privileged customers will still have
   individual IPv4 addresses for their IPv4 connectivity, more and more
   and more others will have only shared IPv4 addresses.

   4rd is a generic solution, for the residual support of global IPv4
   connectivity across IPv6 network infrastructure.  On the tradeoff
   scale between efficiency of address sharing ratios and simplicity,
   4rd is on the side of design and operational simplicity.  Depending
   on SP's constraints and policies, 4rd can be used either alone, not
   NAT being in this case needed in SP's network infrastructure, or in
   parallel with NAT based solutions that achieve better address sharing
   ratios such as DS-lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] and NAT64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] / DNS64 [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64]
   .


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   4rd prefix:           Either IPv4 prefix or address selected by the
                         service provider.  There is one 4rd prefix for
                         a given 4rd domain.  An SP may deploy 4rd with
                         a single 4rd domain or multiple 4rd domain.

   4rd Customer Edge (4rd CE):  A device functioning as a Customer Edge
                         router in 4rd domain.  This node has IPv6
                         interface at CE WAN side, IPv4 interface at CE
                         LAN side and virtual interface of 4rd domain
                         acting as the end-point of 4rd tunnel (IPv4 in
                         IPv6).  It may be a host, a router, or both.

   IPv6 mask:            IPv6 prefix.  All IPv6 delegated prefix for all
                         4rd CEs must be covered by this prefix.

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Residual Deployment           February 2011


   IPv6 delegated prefix:  IPv6 prefix on CE WAN interface of 4rd CE
                         which is delegated by either RA or DHCP-PD from
                         SP's network infrastructure.  This prefix must
                         be covered by IPv6 mask.

   4rd delegated address:  Either IPv4 address or IPv4 address with a
                         specified port range (A+P address) calculated
                         from the combination of a IPv6 delegated prefix
                         and 4rd base prefix by the 4rd CE

   4rd domain:           A set of 4rd CEs and BRs connected to the same
                         virtual 4rd link.  A service provider may
                         deploy 4rd with either a single 4rd domain or
                         multiple 4rd domains.  Each domain requires a
                         separate 4rd prefix.

   CE LAN side:          The functionality of 4rd CE that serves the
                         "Local Area Network (LAN)" or "customer-facing"
                         side of the CE.  IPv4 is running on the CE LAN
                         side interface.

   CE WAN side:          The functionality of 4rd CE that serves the
                         "Wide Area Network (WAN)" or "Service Provider
                         facing" side of the CE.  The CE WAN side is
                         IPv6-only.

   4rd Border Relay (4rd BR):  4rd-enabled router managed by the service
                         provider at the edge of 4rd domain.  A border
                         relay router has IPv4 interface connected to
                         native IPv4 network like the IPv4 Internet,
                         IPv6 interface connected to all 4rd CEs and
                         virtual interface of 4rd domain acting as the
                         end-point of 4rd tunnel (IPv4 in IPv6).  A 4rd
                         BR may also be referred to simply as a "BR"
                         within the context of 4rd.

   BR IPv6 address:      The IPv6 address of the 4rd Border Relay for a
                         given 4rd domain.  This IPv6 address is used by
                         the CEs to send packets to a BR in order to
                         reach IPv4 destinations outside of the 4rd
                         domain.

   4rd virtual interface:  Internal multi-point tunnel interface where
                         4rd encapsulation and decapsulation of IPv4
                         packets must be done inside of IPv6.

4.  4rd Protocol Specification

4.1.  Address Mapping Rule

   4rd address mapping rule establishes 1:1 address mapping between IPv6
   delegated prefix and 4rd delegated address.

   4rd CE generates 4rd delegated address including IPv4 address and
   port range from IPv6 delegated prefix. 4rd BR can associate IPv6
   delegated prefix on specified 4rd CE with IPv4 destination address
   and destination port number in received IPv4 packets.

   Figure 1 shows the address mapping rule between the IPv6 delegated
   prefix and the 4rd delegated address.  As the prerequisite of 4rd,
   IPv6 mask and 4rd prefix must be given to all 4rd CEs and 4rd BRs in
   a specified 4rd domain.  IPv6 delegated prefix for all 4rd CEs in the
   specified 4rd domain must have the same IPv6 mask but must be unique
   for each 4rd CE.  In addition, suffix and interface ID in IPv6
   address must be given to all 4rd CEs and 4rd BRs in order to generate
   4rd tunnel end-point address.

   Prerequisite parameters:

   IPv6 mask:            The number of high-order bits that are
                         identical across all CEs' IPv6 prefix within a
                         given 4rd domain.  For example, if there are 32
                         identical bits (e.g., the internal Ipv6 address
                         range 2001:db8::/32 is being used), IPv6 mask
                         length is equal to 32 and the high-order IPv6
                         mask length bits are stripped from the IPv6
                         prefix before constructing the corresponding
                         4rd delegated address.  This must be given to
                         all 4rd CEs and 4rd BRs in the given 4rd
                         domain.

   4rd prefix:           4rd prefix is IPv4 prefix.  This must be given
                         to all 4rd CEs and 4rd BRs in a specified 4rd
                         domain.

   When delegating IPv6 prefix to a 4rd CE in a 4rd domain, the 4rd CE
   generates 4rd delegated address as follow.  First, the 4rd CE
   retrieves User Identifier, which following IPv6 mask with appropriate
   length of bits calculated by

   o  (IPv6 delegated prefix length - IPv6 mask length)

   The User Identification can be embedded in IPv4 address following 4rd
   prefix.  If all User Identifier bits can not be embedded in IPv4

   address, the remaining bits must be embedded to the port prefix
   described in Section 4.2.  This generated IPv4 address may be
   provided to NAPT on the 4rd CE in order to provide the IPv4
   connectivity to all clients on CE LAN side.

   For example, in a 4rd domain, IPv6 mask is given as 2001:db8::/32.
   4rd prefix is given as 10.10.0.0/16.  If IPv6 delegated prefix is
   2001:db8:ABCD::/48 on a specified 4rd CE, the 4rd CE can extract
   0xABCD as its User Identifier.  All 16 bits of User Identifier
   succeeds to be embedded to the rest of IPv4 address.  Hence, 4rd CE
   generates 10.10.171(0xAB).205(0xCD) as its IPv4 address.  In another
   case, when given delegated IPv6 prefix is 2001:db8:ABCD:EF00::/56 for
   the 4rd CE, the 4rd CE generates same 10.10.171.205 as its IPv4
   address.  But there is 8 bits of User Identifier.  The remaining
   bits, 0xEF, of the User Identifier will be embedded as the port
   prefix described in Section 4.2.

   4rd prefix identifier:  the value grater than 0 bit.  This value is
                         used as the key for specifying a 4rd base
                         prefix.  This describes in Section 6.1.

4.2.  Port-Range

   When delegating IPv6 prefix to a specified 4rd CE in a specified 4rd
   domain, the 4rd CE extract its User Identifier as described in
   Section 4.1.  If all bits of the User Identifier can not be embedded
   to IPv4 address following 4rd prefix, the remaining bits must be
   embedded as the port prefix.

   Figure 2 shows the port range generated from port range index and
   port prefix.  In order to eliminate the well-known port from the port
   range, the port range index (1, 01, 001 or 0001) must be used.  The
   remaining bits of the User Identifier must be embedded as the port
   prefix following the port range index.  If the length of the
   remaining bits is less than 12 bits, all of 4 port range index (1,
   01, 001 and 0001) should be used for the port range.  If the length
   of the remaining bits is 13 bits, 3 port range index (1, 01 and 001)
   should be used.  If the length of the remaining bits is 14 bits, 2
   port range index (1 and 01) should be used.  If the length of the
   remaining bits is 15 bits, only 1 port range index (1) should be
   used.  If the length of the remaining bits is greater than 16 bits,
   4rd delegated address can not be generated.  The generated port-range
   may be provided to NAPT on 4rd CE in order to provide IPv4
   connectivity to all clients on CE LAN side.

   For example, if the User Identifier is 0xABCDEF and 0xABCD can be
   embedded in IPv4 address, the remaining bits 0xEF must be embedded as
   the port prefix.  Since the length of the remaining bits, 0xEF, is 8
   bits, all of the port range index, 0, 01, 001 and 0001, should be
   used.  Finally, the 4rd CE generates 4 port-ranges, 0xF780 to 0xF7FF,
   0x7BC9 to 9x7BFF, 0x3DE0 to 0x3DFF and 0x1EF0 to 0x1EFF as shown in
   Figure 2.

   When a 4rd BR in a specified 4rd domain receives IPv4 packets from
   native IPv4 network, 4rd BR can get the part of the User Identifier
   from its IPv4 destination address described in Section 4.1.  Also,
   the 4rd BR needs to extract the remaining part of the User Identifier
   from the destination port number.  Since the 4rd BR knows the total
   length of the User Identification as described in Section 4.1, the
   4rd BR can know the length of the remaining part of the User
   identification which must be extracted from the destination port
   number.  At first, the starting point of the part of the User
   identification in the destination address must be figured out.  For
   this, the 4rd BR find the first bit which is set to 1 because the
   port range index is located in the beginning of the destination port.
   If finding the starting point of the part of the User Identifier, the
   4rd BR extracts the remaining part of the User Identification.

   A 4rd CE and BR that receives IPv4 packets from IPv4 network checks
   the validity of its source and destination addresses.  It also checks
   that the packet size is acceptable.  If yes, it encapsulates it in an
   IPv6 packet and forwards it at SP's network infrastructure.  The IPv6
   destination address is set to 4rd BR in case of 4rd CE if the IPv4
   destination address in the received packet is not 4rd delegated
   address.  Also the IPv6 destination address is set to the address
   derived by using the address mapping rule (Section 4.1) in case of
   4rd CE and 4rd BR if the IPv4 destination address in the received
   packet is 4rd delegated address.

   The Next-header field of the encapsulating packet is set to "IPv4".
   (Note: The existed protocol number should be reused for 4rd as well.
   4rd can provide the function to transfer IPv4 packets over SP's IPv6
   network infrastructure.  Hence, Protocol 4, "IPv4", must be used as
   the Next-header field of the encapsulated packet).

   Symmetrically, a 4rd CE and 4rd BR that receives IPv6 packet from
   SP's IPv6 network infrastructure checks the validity of source and
   destination addresses in both its encapsulating and encapsulated
   packets.  It also checks that they are mutually consistent with
   address mapping rules (described in Section 4.1).  If yes, it
   decapsulates the IPv4 packet contained in the encapsulating packet,

   and forwards it to its IPv4 interface.

4.4.  PMTU Consideration

   To properly deal with the large size IPv4 datagrams that some
   applications use, in particular with UDP, precautions are needed
   because of the important difference between IPv4 and IPv6 treatments
   of datagram fragmentation, and because ports, that may have to be
   known in 4rd CEs and BRs, only appear in first fragments of long
   datagrams.  (Since SP's network infrastructure is IPv6, intermediate
   node discards the packets which are longer than the MTU of next links
   to be traversed and ends ICMP Packet Too Big ICMPv6 error packets
   back to sources.  However, because all IPv6 links must support all
   packets up to 1280 octets, such discards are completely avoided by
   sources that limit each fragment size to 1280 octets when source and
   destination are not on the same link.).

   To cope with these constraints, a logically simple solution is that
   4rd CEs and 4rd BRs reassemble multi-fragment IPv4 datagrams before
   processing them.  (This function is stateful at the IP layer like the
   same function in NATs.  But 4rd remains stateless at the transport-
   connection layer, while NATs are stateful at this layer, and above
   this layer if they support ALGs.)  After reassembly if applicable,
   each datagram is processed as a single packet and fragmented again to
   fit to PMTU in the SP's IPv6 network infrastructure in 4rd CE and 4rd
   BR before encapsulating in IPv6.  After encapsulating each fragmented
   IPv4 packet in IPv6 in 4rd CE and 4rd BR, it is forwarded over SP's
   IPv6 netowkr infrastructure.

4.5.  Parameter Acquisition

   The method of parameter acquisition at 4rd CE is further study.


5.  4rd Configuration

   This section defines the relevant protocol parameters used for 4rd.
   The following constants must be mandatory on both 4rd CE and 4rd BR.

   Common Constants for both 4rd CE and 4rd BR:

   IPV6_MASK_LEN (length of IPv6 mask):  The prefix length of IPv6 mask.
                         The IPv6 mask can be gotten from IPv6 delegated
                         prefix by this length.  For example,
                         IPV6_MASK_LEN is given as 32 bits.  If the IPv6
                         delegated prefix is 2001:db8:abcd::/48, 2001:
                         db8::/32 can be gotten as IPv6 mask in a
                         specified 4rd domain.

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Residual Deployment           February 2011


   4RD_PREFIX (4rd prefix of 4rd delegated address):  Either IPv4 prefix
                         or IPv4 address. 4rd delegated address can be
                         generated by using the combination of this
                         prefix and the User Identifier extracted from
                         IPv6 delegated prefix.

   SUFFIX (Suffix of IPv6 prefix):  This valus is used for filling the
                         rest of IPv6 prefix.

   INTERFACE_ID (Interface ID of IPv6 address):  This value is used for
                         filling in the last 64 bits of IPv6 address.

   4RD_BR_ADDRESS (4rd BR address):  This specifies the IPv6 address of
                         4rd BR in a specified 4rd domain.  If the IPv4
                         destination address is not based on 4rd prefix,
                         4rd CE forwards the packets to 4rd BR after
                         encapsulating in IPv6.

5.1.  Behavior of 4rd BR

5.1.1.  Address Mapping

   There is no need to generate 4rd delegated address at 4rd BR.  An
   IPv6 address facing to SP's IPv6 network infrastructure can be
   configured by using several methods including static configuration,
   RA, DHCPv6, etc.

5.1.2.  Packet Forwarding

   When receiving the encapsulated packets from SP's IPv6 network
   infrastructure, 4rd BR removes IPv6 header and then decapsulates IPv4
   packets contained in IPv6 packet.  After decapsulating, IPv4 packet
   can be transported to native IPv4 network.

   When a 4rd BR in a specified 4rd domain receives IPv4 packets from
   native IPv4 network, the 4rd BR must associate IPv6 address of the
   receiver 4rd CE with the IPv4 destination address and destination
   port number.  Since 4rd prefix is given to the 4rd BR, the 4rd BR can
   extract the part of User Identifier following 4rd prefix from IPv4
   destination address.  And 4rd BR can extract the remaining part of
   User Identifier from the destination port number described in
   Section 4.2.  Finally, the 4rd BR can generate IPv6 destination
   address from the combination of the IPv6 mask and this extracted User
   Identifier.

   For example, in a specified 4rd domain, IPv6 mask is given as 2001:
   db8::/32. 4rd prefix is given as 10.10.0.0/16.  The length of the
   IPv6 delegated prefix on 4rd CE is given as 56 bits.  In this case,



Despres, et al.          Expires August 15, 2011               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Residual Deployment           February 2011


   the length of User Identifier can be calculated as 24 bits.  If the
   4rd BR receives IPv4 packets whose destination address is
   100.10.171.205 and destination port is 63360(0xF780), the last 16
   bits, 0xABCD, of IPv4 destination address can be extracted as the
   part of its User Identifier and the remaining 8 bits can be extracted
   from the destination port as 0xEF described in Section 4.2.  Finally,
   4rd BR can generate 2001:db8:abcd:ef00::/56 as IPv6 delegated prefix
   of the receiver 4rd CE from the combination of IPv6 mask and
   extracted User Identifier and then decide the IPv6 destination
   address of the receiver 4rd CE by adding both given suffix and given
   Interface ID on this IPv6 delegated prefix.

   When receiving IPv4 packets from native IPv4 network, all fragmented
   packets is assembled in a single packet if needed and then 4rd BR
   processes the following operation.

   If IPv4 destination address is based on 4rd prefix, 4rd BR generates
   IPv6 destination address by using address mapping rules described in
   section 4rd Protocol Specification If IPv4 destination address is not
   based on 4rd prefix, 4rd BR may discard the packets.

5.2.  Behavior of 4rd CE

5.2.1.  Address Mapping

   4rd CE gets IPv6 mask and its User Identifier from IPv6 delegated
   prefix and generates 4rd delegated address.  Since IPv6 mask length
   is given, the length of its User Identifier can be calculated by
   doing the length of IPv6 delegated prefix minus the length of IPv6
   mask upon delegating IPv6 prefix from the SP's IPv6 network
   infrastructure.  At the same time, 4rd CE gets IPv6 mask by
   extracting the first bits of the length specified by IPV6_MASK_LEN
   and also its User Identifier by extracting the bits following IPv6
   mask.

   After that, some of bits from its User Identifier can be embedded in
   IPv4 address after 4rd prefix.  If there are still remaining bits of
   its User Identifier, these bits are embedded as port prefix described
   in Section 4.  Finally, 4rd CE can generate 4rd delegated address.
   In addition, 4rd CE may provide this 4rd delegated address to NAPT in
   order to provide IPv4 connectivity to all clients on CE LAN side.

5.2.2.  Packet Forwarding

   When receiving IPv4 packets from the clients on CE LAN side, the
   following operation must be done.

   If IPv4 packet is fragmented, IPv4 packet is reassembled before



Despres, et al.          Expires August 15, 2011               [Page 11]

   processing.

   If NAT is used, the source address and the source port can be changed
   by using 4rd delegated address.

   If IPv4 destination is based on 4rd prefix, 4rd CE generates IPv6
   destination address from IPv4 destination address and destination
   port similar to 4rd BR.  If IPv4 destination address is not based on
   4rd prefix, 4rd CE uses 4RD_BR_ADDRESS as IPv6 destination.

   After deciding the IPv6 destination, 4rd CE checks PMTU in SP's IPv6
   network infrastructure.  The IPv4 packet can be fragmented if needed
   before encapsulating in IPv6.  And 4rd CE encapsulates IPv4 packet in
   IPv6 and then forwards it to SP's IPv6 network infrastructure.

   When receiving IPv6 packet from SP's IPv6 network infrastructure, 4rd
   CE removes IPv6 header and then decapsulates IPv4 packet after
   checking the source and destination address in both encapsulating and
   encapsulated packets.  After that, the decapsulated IPv4 packet is
   forwarded to the client on CE LAN side after processing NAT if
   needed.


6.  Optional Behavior

6.1.  Multiple 4rd prefix support

   Multiple 4rd prefix should be used for both 4rd CE and 4rd BR when
   residual IPv4 prefix size is not enough to provide all 4rd domain.
   4rd CE must figure out the appropriate 4rd prefix upon generating 4rd
   delegated address.  Also, 4rd BR must figure out the appropriate 4rd
   prefix upon generating IPv6 destination address.  For this, 4rd
   prefix database can be implemented on both 4rd CE and 4rd BR.  The
   entry in 4rd prefix database stores the following information.


              {4rd prefix}
                       <--> {4rd prefix identifier, IPv6 mask,
                             length of user identifier }

                       Figure 3: 4rd prefix database

   4rd prefix:           IPv4 prefix for specified 4rd domain.

   4rd prefix identifier:  the key for a specific 4rd domain.  This is a
                         bit pattern with its length.

Internet-Draft          IPv4 Residual Deployment           February 2011


   IPv6 mask:            IPv6 mask for a specific 4rd domain.

   Length of User Identifier  Length of User Identifier for a specific
                         4rd domain.

   When delegating IPv6 prefix to 4rd CE, 4rd CE extracts 4rd prefix
   identifier following IPv6 mask (see 4rd Address Mapping). 4rd CE
   looks up the entry matched to 4rd prefix identifier by using longest
   match manner.  If the entry is found, 4rd CE can use 4rd prefix
   stored in this entry, extract its User Identifier following 4rd
   prefix identifier in IPv6 delegated prefix and then generate 4rd
   delegated address.

   When generating IPv6 destination address from IPv4 destination
   address and destination port on 4rd BR, 4rd BR looks up the entry
   matched to 4rd prefix by using longest match manner.  If the entry is
   found, 4rd BR can extract its User Identifier from IPv4 destination
   address and destination port based on the length of User Identifier
   stored in the entry and then generates IPv6 destination from the
   combination of IPv6 mask stored in the entry and extracted User
   Identifier.


7.  Security Considerations

   In order to prevent from spoofing attack, the address-consistency of
   the source address of the encapsulating and encapsulated packets must
   be checked upon receiving the packets from a 4rd domain.  If the IPv4
   source address in encapsulated IPv4 packet is based on 4rd prefix,
   IPv4 source address in encapsulated IPv4 packet must be able to be
   generated from IPv6 source address in encapsulating IPv6 packet.  If
   the IPv4 source address is not based on 4rd prefix, the destination
   address of the reverse path toward the IPv4 source address in
   encapsulated IPv4 packet must be same as IPv6 source address in
   encapsulating IPv6 packet.

   In order to avoid forwarding loop, both 4rd BR and 4rd CE must not
   forward the packets received from a specified 4rd domain to the same
   4rd domain.
